jvqplot - a very simple plotting program


   Jvqplot is a plotting program, resembling a simplified version of
gnuplot.  It is very simple to use, but it can only plot simple data
files.  The format and scaling of the plot is automatically chosen and
cannot be changed.

   Generic installation instructions are in the file INSTALL, you will
need the GTK+ library in order to compile the program.  A short manual
is contained in the included manual page jvqplot.1.

   Jvqplot comes with NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
You may redistribute copies of jvqplot under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.  For more information about these matters,

   Please mail any suggestions and bug reports to Jochen Voss
<voss@seehuhn.de>.  Your message should include the jvqplot version
number, as obtained by the command 'jvqplot -v'.
